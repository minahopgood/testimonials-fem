## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS animations
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I tried to complete the challenge as extensively as I could. Creating @media queries for as many screen sizes as resonable and adding a pulsing hover state to the profile pictures. I am very proud of my attempt at this as there were more problems than expected, and even though the solutions may not be the most efficient, I was still able to come up with them.
